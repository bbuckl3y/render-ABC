# render-ABC

*Bob Buckley*

Software to render/merge ABC library files with HTML templates.

This is a script for merging the contents of a ABC music notation file with a HTML template to create a HTML music book that can be used at a gig or for "printing" a PDF file or a paper copy.
The main feature is that it adds optional indices of the tunes that are click-able to go to the tunes.
